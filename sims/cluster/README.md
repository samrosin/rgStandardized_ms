Access to a SLURM-managed high performance computing cluster is assumed for use of these files. For a given DGP with a subdirectory in this directory (all but DGP1 and DGP2), e.g. DGP3, two corresponding subdirectories should be created on SLURM named dgp3_datasets/ and dgp3_results/. The scripts also need to be edited so that the user's home SLURM directory is included. Then run the commands (1) sbatch dgp3_datagen.sh and (2) sbatch dgp3_results.sh. Finally, run the R file dgp3_analyse.R, which will generate the output file dgp3_var_results.csv. This csv file can be used to generate figures in plot_bias.R, plot_var.R, and plot_mse.R.
