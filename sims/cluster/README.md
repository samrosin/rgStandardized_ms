These files assume access to a SLURM-managed high performance computing cluster. For a given DGP, e.g. DGP3, two corresponding subdirectories should be created on SLURM named dgp3_datasets/ and dgp3_results/. The scripts also need to be edited so that the user's home SLURM directory is included. Then run the commands (1) sbatch dgp3_datagen.sh and (2) sbatch dgp3_results.sh. Finally, run the R file dgp3_analyse.R, which will generate the output file dgp3_var_results.csv. This csv file can be used to generate figures in plot_bias.R and plot_var.R.
