The sims are best interacted with for RStudio users by downloading this repository and opening the R project rgStandardized.Rproj. Bias sims are in the bias subdirectory and variance sims are in the var and cluster subdirectories. Four data-generating processes (DGPs) are considered, and DGPs 3 and 4 are more computing-intensive so they are best implemented on a SLURM-managed cluster. Running the scripts puts results in .csv files in the results_draft directory, and final results should be moved into the results_final directory, from which they can be analyzed using the plot_bias.R and plot_var.R scripts. Parameter values like sensitivity, specificity, sample sizes, etc. can be tweaked within the inputs subdirectory.
