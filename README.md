# rgStandardized
Standardized Rogan-Gladen method for prevalence estimation, with applications to SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Manuscript in preparation. 

Estimators are implemented in estmation_fns.R, and a nonparametric standardization estimator is also implemented in rgStandardized_worksheet.xlsx. The worksheet can be used for entering data from a seroprevalence study to obtain standardized Rogan-Gladen estimates with confidence intervals.
