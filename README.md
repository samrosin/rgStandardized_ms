# rgStandardized
Standardized Rogan-Gladen method for prevalence estimation, with applications to SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Manuscript in preparation. 

This code in this repository is currently in draft form and there may be errors included. With that disclaimer, estimators are implemented in estimation_fns.R, and a nonparametric standardization estimator is also implemented in rgStandardized_worksheet.xlsx. The worksheet can be used for entering data from a seroprevalence study to obtain standardized Rogan-Gladen estimates with confidence intervals. 

See the sims and data_analyses subdirectories for relevant materials; separate READMEs exist for each directory.
