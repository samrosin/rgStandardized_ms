# rgStandardized_ms
This code and supplemental information accompanies the manuscript "Estimating SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence" by Samuel Rosin, Bonnie Shook-Sa, Stephen Cole, and Michael Hudgens. The current manuscript version can be found [at this arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02910).

This code in this repository is currently in draft form and there may be errors included. With that disclaimer, estimators are implemented in estimation_fns.R, and a nonparametric standardization estimator is also implemented in rgStandardized_worksheet.xlsx. The worksheet can be used for entering data from a seroprevalence study to obtain standardized Rogan-Gladen estimates with confidence intervals. 

See the sims and data_analyses subdirectories for relevant materials; separate READMEs exist for each directory.
